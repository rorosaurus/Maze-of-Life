I wrote my assignment using Java using IntelliJ IDEA.

You can obtain the free Community Version of IDEA here: http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html

You can obtain the Java JDK/JVM from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

The JDK/JVM is needed to run my assignment, but IDEA is not.  I have included my project files if you wish to view them in IDEA.

Alternatively, you can view my source in your desired program and run the supplied compiled .jar file from command line via

    java -jar MazeOfLife.jar 1

This command should be executed in the directory containing my project.  '1' can be substituted for any of the 5 puzzles.

You could also specify an absolute path to a file instead of a number.

Please contact me at roryohayes@gmail.com if you have any problems or a question!

Thanks, happy grading.
