I wrote my assignment in Java using IntelliJ IDEA.

You can obtain the free Community Version of IDEA here: http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html

You can obtain the Java JDK/JVM from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html


The JDK/JVM is needed to run my assignment, but IDEA is not.  I have included my project files if you wish to view them in IDEA.

The JDK I am specifically using is jdk1.7.0_09, straight from Oracle.  I have verified that my code runs properly on all platforms that employ this JDK.

If you are unable to get this code to run on your machine, please verify you are using this or a similar Oracle JDK, and not OpenJDK.


Alternatively, you can view my source in your desired program and run the supplied compiled .jar file from command line via

    java -jar MazeOfLife.jar 1

This command should be executed in the directory containing my project.  '1' can be substituted for any of the 5 puzzles.

You could also specify an absolute path to a file instead of a number.


I compile my code and make the .jar file through IntelliJ IDEA, so I am unfamiliar with the structure of commands used for compilation.

This oracle tutorial mentions using the javac utility, which appears to work with Java source directories with the proper arguments.  I have yet to get this working simply with my project.

Most people use Ant or Maven to compile and organize larger Java projects, but I would prefer to prevent you from having to download and manage those systems.

Therefore, I'd encourage you download and install IntelliJ IDEA to build my project.  You will need to point IntelliJ IDEA to the location of your JDK.

After this initial setup, building my project (and the .jar) can be done by simply clicking the "Make" button, or by running the program.

In the meantime, I will continue to tinker with finding a relatively simple command for you to compile my project yourself.

Thanks, happy grading.
