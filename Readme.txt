This is my implementation of my Maze Of Life assignment for CS 347 at Missouri S&T.

http://web.mst.edu/~tauritzd/courses/cs347/sp2013/puzzle.html

You can view my source in your desired program and run the supplied compiled .jar file from command line via

    java -jar MazeOfLife.jar 1

This command should be executed in the directory containing my project.  '1' can be substituted for any of the 5 puzzles.

You could also specify an absolute path to a file instead of a number.
